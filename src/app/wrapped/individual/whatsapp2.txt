2/14/25, 11:30 AM - +234 811 973 0652: After a month of solid work (and a lot of caffeine ☕😆, I’m excited to introduce Nexios—a lightweight, high-performance Python framework** built to make development faster, cleaner, and more scalable! 🐍⚡  


nexiosis  the framework you wish you had earlier! Whether you’re building APIs, web apps, or full-stack platforms, Nexios gives you:  
✅ Speed & Simplicity – No unnecessary bloat, just raw performance.  
✅ ORM Flexibility – Works with SQL, NoSQL, or whatever fits your project.  
✅ Multiple Auth Methods – Because login screens shouldn’t give you nightmares.  
✅ Scalability & Microservices Ready – Build small, grow big!  
✅ Minimalist but Powerful – Keep your code clean without losing features.  

🌍 Real-World Use Case: Buzzbuntu Social 
My company, Buzzbuntu, has already built a social media platform using Nexios—fast, interactive, and designed to handle real-world scaling. 🚀  
BUT… some meta features (👀) are still cooking because, well, the docs aren’t ready yet. 😂 Trust me, they’re coming soon!

I built a REST API in minutes using Nexios, the lightweight Python framework that I created! 🤯🔥  

If you're still wrestling with Django’s 500-line settings file or Flask’s “DIY everything” toolkit, I gotta ask…  
if you're not using Nexios, what are you using? Morse code? A carrier pigeon? Prayers? 😂  

Nexios makes API development fast, simple, and fun—no unnecessary complexity, no boilerplate headaches. Just clean and efficient code.

Has anyone here ever used Pjsip in python to handle calls. I read the docs but it doesn't seem to be much help

I was asked to implement something using Pjsip that can helpbease customer service repetitive task of calling for feedback. So in this case now an AI will collect the feedback 

I already have a system in place to handle responses coming from the AI. All u need now is to connect it to Pjsip for the back and forth communication 

I know there are better options but I was asked specifically to use Pjsip so any help or resources would be appreciated

I’m building Nexios, a Python framework that’s about to shake things up, and I’m putting out a call to arms! I’m also setting up Nexios-Labs, an open-source community where we build, break, and improve Nexios together. This ain’t just another framework—it’s a movement! 🚀

What’s Done So Far?
✅ Core Framework – Nexios is up and running with a solid foundation.
✅ Authentication System – Built a flexible auth system that works with any ORM.
✅ Middleware & Routing – Lightweight, efficient, and designed for speed.
✅ CLI Tool – Developers can scaffold projects quickly with Nexios CLI.
✅ Modular Structure – Everything is extendable, plug-and-play style.
✅ Active Repo & Open Source – The code is live and ready for contributions!

What We Need Next?
✅ Docs – If you can explain Nexios like you’re talking to a 5-year-old, we need you!
✅ Testing – Find bugs, break things, make Nexios bulletproof!
✅ Feature Ideas – Got a crazy idea? Drop it. We’re listening!
✅ Bug Hunting – See something off? Report it. Fix it.
✅ Discussions – Let’s talk, argue (respectfully 😆), and brainstorm.

If you’ve ever wanted to be part of an open-source project from DAY ONE, this is it. Don’t just watch from the sidelines—jump in and let’s build something 🔥 together.

Quite busy, but found just enough time to wrap up a blog article.

I just published an awesome article on the Zed Labs blog. A beautiful piece(largely inspired by my personal experience) on how mastering self learning can make you a 'fearless' and avid-learning software engineering professional.

Head to the Zed Labs blog and see for yourself. Quite a lot in there to top up your day.

Just one more sensational article before I take a posting break for the easter season. 

In this detailed piece, I trace the journey and key developments that positioned Tailwind CSS as a leading force in the frontend development landscape.

By examining the evolution of web styling approaches and technical shifts in the industry(through the lens of my engineering experience over the years), this article highlights the pivotal moments that created the environment where Tailwind's utility-first methodology could flourish and gain widespread adoption.

To make things all perfect, I shared extremely valuable code samples and screenshots along the way. I also shared some awesome features of Tailwind - showing you real reasons why hating it is simply a bad idea.

A truly value-packed article for UI/Front-end engineers of all categories.

See you inside.

I just published this awesome piece a moment ago.

It's an ideal article for software engineers of all categories - especially for cloud and DevOps engineers.

Check it out, and get to learn so much about SSH and it's most commonly used(public key) authentication method. 

You'll get to learn:

1. How SSH(public key auth) connection key-pairs are created and how they are shared between connections.
2. How SSH connections can be between 2 remote servers - not necessarily between you local computer and one remote server.
3. How SSH contributes to making different DevOps and cloud operations possible.
4. More.

I trust you'll find so much value - enjoy the read.

Cheers!!!

This greatly boosts confidence. Join other developers on projects too. It helps a lot. You could be writing shitty code and not really know it. <This message was edited>

6/22/25, 10:54 PM - +234 906 876 2493: start posting on twitter
6/22/25, 10:54 PM - +234 906 876 2493: quality stuff
6/22/25, 10:54 PM - +234 808 556 1218: Connect with people more. There's always one person that needs your skill set. That aside, if I may ask how may YOE do you have. Be known for one thing (doesn't mean you should not do other things).
The strategy is, be that talent that your close network would first think of when an opportunity comes. Goodluck to us as we keep on looking for gigs.
6/22/25, 10:55 PM - +234 906 876 2493: build unique stuffs and post on twitter
6/22/25, 10:56 PM - +234 808 556 1218: One day I go try all these SM thing.  I hear LinkedIn, X. I don too dey hear about this "Post post".

6/22/25, 11:00 PM - +234 808 556 1218: Sharp. ✅
6/22/25, 11:02 PM - +234 810 149 1460: With four years of experience in tech, gained from self-study since age 15, I'm now preparing to enter university at 19. I've been exploring ways to monetize my skills.
6/22/25, 11:03 PM - +234 808 556 1218: Waaaaaait.
6/22/25, 11:03 PM - +234 706 226 4650: Do you have portfolio?
6/22/25, 11:04 PM - +234 703 930 1841: Wow!
Awesome
6/22/25, 11:04 PM - +234 915 230 7875: That's not years of experience man <This message was edited>
6/22/25, 11:04 PM - +234 808 556 1218: Not to sound insensitive. For those four years you haven't worked on a real life project yet? 
4 YOE (industrial) is different from how long you have been coding. 
That's just few steps to becoming a senior.
6/22/25, 11:05 PM - +234 915 230 7875: YOE is for years spent actually working, not learning
6/22/25, 11:05 PM - +234 810 149 1460: I'm working on it 
But this is one of my projects on github with flask
6/22/25, 11:05 PM - +234 810 149 1460: https://github.com/beeboy11/WebSage
6/22/25, 11:05 PM - +234 915 230 7875: In fact gap years aren't counted as part of your YOE for that reason.
6/22/25, 11:08 PM - +234 808 556 1218: Omoooooo. Make I no lie for you. Recruiter no get time to check github. The project is supposed to be online (that's if they try checking out your work).
6/22/25, 11:09 PM - +234 703 930 1841: I wanted to say this
6/22/25, 11:09 PM - +234 808 556 1218: Your code snippets only matters to the technical guy after he sees the functionality of your application.
6/22/25, 11:10 PM - +234 703 930 1841: Try deploying it maybe on render and and the link to your portfolio
6/22/25, 11:10 PM - +234 810 149 1460: I was once told that some recruiters don't care about your cv
They only check your github and portfolio
6/22/25, 11:10 PM - +234 810 149 1460: Okay 👍
6/22/25, 11:12 PM - +234 808 556 1218: Brooo. The space is brutal (I don't know about Naija market cause I rarely apply for their jobs). 
Na now I realise sey dem no dey see all these portfolio whatever. Dem no too get that time.
6/22/25, 11:13 PM - +234 808 556 1218: The two mentioned does not replace a resume oh. 
Resume is what gets you to the next round before they can even think of viewing your portfolio or github.
6/22/25, 11:15 PM - +234 706 781 5184: <Media omitted>
6/22/25, 11:15 PM - +234 808 556 1218: To be frank with you. You still need dey more exposed. 4 years in you suppose don sabi all these things. It's enough for to have started balling too. Please don't feel less of your self. I just don't know.how to mince words.
6/22/25, 11:17 PM - +234 906 876 2493: @⁨~🐝🐝🐝⁩

6/22/25, 11:19 PM - +234 906 876 2493: @⁨~🐝🐝🐝⁩ 
it's not age discrimination, but I want to give you a very serious advise if the answer is yes
6/22/25, 11:19 PM - +234 810 149 1460: Yes
6/22/25, 11:19 PM - +234 915 230 7875: E no tire you?
6/22/25, 11:21 PM - +234 808 556 1218: 😂😂 If space dey make I just follow them. I want use like 2 months lock in to get my proper job.
6/22/25, 11:22 PM - +234 808 556 1218: What region have you been applying to though?
6/22/25, 11:22 PM - +234 811 329 6008: anyone currently learning Django?
6/22/25, 11:22 PM - +234 810 149 1460: Nigeria
6/22/25, 11:23 PM - +234 906 876 2493: thank you,
if you do, for now, forget hunting for jobs like a hyena
bcus u'd hunt to no end

keep crafting your skill, keep polishing it
build, build quality projects and experiences
stick to one thing, why web and app, no body hires one for both, that's amature move 
share your builds on SM, that is the closest thing to a global network that you have..... use X, use X, use X
build quality web apps, or build quality mobile apps
6/22/25, 11:23 PM - +234 808 556 1218: Only start with Nigeria for faster employment and experience. When you realise your real worth like me. Change your location. Also don't take shit from those guys ooh (foreign recruiters)
6/22/25, 11:24 PM - +234 810 149 1460: Additionally, I'd like to inquire about the significance of holding a computer science degree for job prospects in the tech industry.
6/22/25, 11:25 PM - ~ The Code Ninja left
6/22/25, 11:26 PM - +234 906 876 2493: share your builds on social media, that's your  online CV, 
build your portfolio, that's your resume

📌📌📌 Don't get caught up with shiny object syndrome, you would bleed time with nothing to show for
6/22/25, 11:27 PM - +234 703 930 1841: Not a criteria. Though it gives an edge
6/22/25, 11:27 PM - +234 810 149 1460: Used to do this on Facebook back when I was into WordPress. Appreciate the tips. I will keep them in mind!
6/22/25, 11:29 PM - +234 810 149 1460: Okay
6/22/25, 11:30 PM - +234 906 876 2493: hold it if that's what you are going for,

ATS doesn't give a flying fuck if you built an OS system in binary if it doesn't see some keywords like degree in computer science if it has been programmed to filter out non CS grad

because not all CVs reaches the eyes of humans for them to even be considerate
6/22/25, 11:32 PM - +234 906 876 2493: the idea people get jobs without CS degree is very true, but you'd never here how hard it was for a non CS grad than a CS grad

you'd also never here that very qualified non CS grad who didn't get lead engineer role, life is beyond entry level role <This message was edited>
6/22/25, 11:32 PM - +234 808 556 1218: Valid point, but one thing doesn't really work based on my own perspective. Which is to stop hunting for jobs. 
For me, while I was learning some years ago at Meta. I subscribed to some job alerts. The figures kept motivating me to push harder in my learning journey. From the JDs I was able to identity the skill sets I need to be employable. 
He doesn't need to build 1M side projects before he feels like he can now start applying. He should rather focus on getting an internship (paid/unpaid) depends on him. Left for me, I don't work for free and would NEVER work for free. 😂😂
He should connect with more people, jump on paid side projects. Sitting in one corner to build maaaaaad projects you want to add to your portfolio doesn't have much impact compared to a product that's being used in the real world. By "real world", I mean there are users of the application. It's not just sitting on your repo. 
Goodluck to us in getting and internship.😂
6/22/25, 11:35 PM - +234 906 876 2493: IKR, it's crazy how different things works for different people

but you say you where learning where?

6/23/25, 3:29 PM - +234 911 519 7167: Well balancing skl with tech isn't too easy sha

6/23/25, 3:31 PM - +234 808 556 1218: One secret I would tell you. 
Don't wait until Uni. You have a lot of potential in you. I am not trying to let you see how much you can make. But if the time you've been in this really corresponds with your skill set. Omooooooooooo X5

But the code base was really messy. It does not follow proper standards and design pattern was not scalable for the scope of the project.

like

send 2k to 7031272572 palmpay
I want it to return 
Acct number: 7031272572

But i am looking for a free ai with a free api and no limits!
please can anyone suggest
6/28/25, 3:29 PM - +234 916 840 3177: Regex can handle things like this, I'm not sure you need an AI though for this your cited use-case. <This message was edited>
6/28/25, 3:30 PM - +234 911 519 7167: i do!

i also need the ai to respond to some input that some users can put that is not related to finance

6/28/25, 3:32 PM - +234 911 519 7167: and its still gonna respond to some stupid inputs by the user..
6/28/25, 3:33 PM - +234 911 519 7167: and like 1 request can take 1000 tokens

I’ve been working on a Python framework called Nexios  built a few MVPs with it (solo & with a team), and it’s getting pretty stable now.

🚀 Nexios is a blazing fast ASGI framework for Python.
Think Express.js, but async-native and Python-powered  designed for speed, control, and zero bloat.

⚡ It’s super lightweight, crazy fast in benchmarks, and perfect for APIs & real-time apps.

We’re just getting started  would love your feedback!
✨ Try it out, drop a ⭐, and feel free to contribute if you vibe with the vision.

We all know  we’ve reached our maximum capacity. From now on, it’s no longer about numbers , it’s about quality.

We’re building something elite , a space for the best of the best 🤌.
This isn’t just a place to say “I want to be part of the community” ,  it’s a place to ask,
“What value can I bring to the community?” 💀

We’re creating a space where only the top 1% of Python developers in Nigeria belong 🔥.
A VIP circle for those who truly stand out 🥵.
We’re not assembling a crowd ,  we’re assembling the Avengers🛡️


📢 Which makes us decide: 
Although We already know the people who bring value,  no need to prove anything anymore.

⛔ A major cleanup is coming soon. So just bare with any changes or inconvenience you might see ,

And If you know you’ve not been active or adding value, feel free to pack your bags and exit quietly 😌 , just like you always do.

 Thank you 🙏.

7/10/25, 12:25 PM - +234 706 518 4789: Revenge of the NERDS?  It’s happening…  Meta just made their "Ronaldo signing" in AI. They poached the guy who built GPT-4o's vision capabilities. 

And OpenAI is probably freaking out right now.

Meet Jiahui Yu - the ex-OpenAI researcher who led the Perception team behind GPT-4o's image generation and multimodal abilities.

This isn't just another hire. This is like Real Madrid signing Ronaldo.

Who is Jiahui Yu? 

☑ Ex-OpenAI top researcher.

☑ Led the team behind GPT-4o's "see and understand" capabilities.

☑ Built core multimodal AI tech that lets ChatGPT process images.

☑ Published breakthrough work on visual transformers and image synthesis.

He's not just smart. He's one of the people who made GPT-4o actually work.

Meta's strategy is insane:

Yu joins Meta's new "Superintelligence team" - an elite unit reporting directly to Zuckerberg. This team is stacked with talent from OpenAI, DeepMind, and Google Brain.

Their mission? Build AI that outsmarts humans in reasoning, planning, and long-term decisions.

Zuckerberg is building his own Manhattan Project for AGI.

The talent war is getting ridiculous:

In the last 60 days, Meta has:

→ Hired Alexandr Wang from Scale AI to lead AGI efforts.

→ Offered $100M+ packages to top researchers.

→ Poached ex-GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.

→ Negotiated a $14.3B stake in Scale AI.

→ Pitched their lab as the place to "build superintelligence fast.”

This isn't recruitment. This is AI warfare.

Why the Ronaldo comparison makes sense:
In soccer, when you're behind, you don't just buy good players. You buy game-changers.

Meta knows they're behind in AGI:

- Llama-4 faced performance delays
- GPT-4o crushed them on multimodal capabilities
- OpenAI's o3 destroyed benchmarks

So what do you do when your models fall short?
You buy the playbook. You hire the architects. You sign Ronaldo.

Here's what this really means:

Meta isn't trying to out-research OpenAI anymore. They're trying to out-hire them.

The message to OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic is clear: "You can build better models. We'll just take the people who built them."

The bigger picture:

This is Zuckerberg's clearest signal yet that Meta is done playing catch-up. They're building an AGI dream team with unlimited budgets.

And Jiahui Yu? He's the kind of signing that changes the entire game.

It’s a trap.
These accounts are used in big financial scams, and you end up facing legal action — including FBR cases, arrests, and heavy fines.

Please, can anyone recommend any good cryptocurrency service provider i can use
 
The aim is to generate unique crypto wallet addresses for each users : 
The supported cryptocurrencies include : 

{BTC, ETH, BNB, TRX, SOL, USDT(bep20, trc20, erc 20, sol usdt ),  USDC( bep20, erc20, solusdc )

If they also provide wallet management, it would be great

So that when users deposit their cryptocurrencies and see their balance in naira , admin of the app can withdraw the cryptocurrency out. 


Thank you 🙏🏾

Before you run npm install. 
Run *sudo apt install npm* 
 (if your container is a debian distro)

Or find any corresponding command for the distro your container is.

Then after that run npm install ...

Are you a vendor, marketer, education consultant, or well-connected professional in the education space?

We’ve got an exciting opportunity for you!

🎯 Here's the Deal:
Refer schools to www.ilearnova.com platform and earn 10% of everything they spend with us — for as long as the school is with us. Yes, you read that right.

Whether you're connected to private schools, learning centers, academics, or administrators — your referrals can generate long-term income for you, while helping schools streamline their operations with Ilearnova school platform.

💡 Why Partner With Us?
✅ High-Quality Product: Our school management system is designed to make life easier for administrators, teachers, and parents.

✅ Easy Referral Process: Simply share your unique referral code. We’ll track everything for you.

✅ Recurring Commission: Get paid every single time the school makes a payment — not just once. That’s passive income!

✅ Dedicated Support: We’ll equip you with marketing material, real-time support, and tools to help you succeed.

✅ Transparent Payouts: We’ll show you exactly how much each school pays and how much you earn — no hidden fees.

💰 Your Earnings Example:
A school pays ₦500,000 for a term subscription.

You earn ₦50,000.

The next term they pay again — you earn another ₦50,000.

Multiply that by several schools, and you’re building serious recurring income!

I’ll be sharing Nexios next week with a few people from the PyCon Africa community and maybe some of the Starlette maintainers too.

If you’ve come across Nexios before or believe in fast, async Python frameworks, a tweet, a quick writeup, or even starring the repo would go a long way in boosting its visibility.

Nexios is like Express.js but for Python. Clean, flexible, and built for serious scale.

Let’s try to hit 1K stars before then. Every single push counts

You're doing great. Keep going.
7/22/25, 9:02 AM - +234 907 304 8473: Hmmm.... this is nice. Thank you
7/22/25, 9:02 AM - +234 905 373 9194: In a summary:

If you know only 1 or more lighter-weight tools like Python or NodeJs, then go with Go.

But if you already know a suitable modern alternative to Go - e.g. Rust.

Then pick Java.

7/22/25, 10:51 AM - +234 808 700 0701: good question, 

Learn Go if you love to reinvent the wheel (build your own stack from scratch).

Learn Rust if you're a rich kid that doesn't need a Job.

If you want a job pick from Java, Python, C++ and of course JS.
7/22/25, 10:51 AM - +234 808 700 0701: Rust may blow up in the future but for now most companies have already built their tech with C++.

Saying there are no current jobs for Rust is simply false.

I actually find that laughable. <This message was edited>

7/22/25, 10:57 AM - +234 808 700 0701: Rust is new tech, there are jobs at startups but startups also use mature tech like C++.

Some companies are rewriting parts of their stack to use Rust because it's memory management is good for security.

But if you want a job go for mature (old) and popular technology with a lot of opportunities not new stuff like Rust.
7/22/25, 10:58 AM - +234 905 373 9194: Thanks for your opinion.
7/22/25, 10:59 AM - +234 808 700 0701: if you grade languages based on ease to get a job, Rust is actually low tier, it's a specific language (for memory safety) similar to how erlang is for concurrency. What you want with a job is generality (a language that's good at many things) that way you have a lot of opportunities
7/22/25, 10:59 AM - +234 907 304 8473: Hmm..if you're looking at posterity's sake, isn't it more rational to go for the one people just begun adopting to their prod development? 
I mean, by your explanation, won't Rust be super okay to learn? <This message was edited>
7/22/25, 11:01 AM - +234 905 373 9194: Are you for real???

Rust - blockchain(especially Solana), Embeded systems(hardware) programming, Backend programming, Ever Frontend programming with something like Leptos.
7/22/25, 11:01 AM - +234 818 964 8342: Guuuuy like you get , it beats the whole explanation because if you start learning that Rust now in years you will be that experienced.
7/22/25, 11:01 AM - +234 905 373 9194: I kindly recommend you do some more research. You're missing a lot of facts.

@⁨~Moses⁩ <This message was edited>
7/22/25, 11:01 AM - +234 808 700 0701: only if you are really experienced in other languages because you will most likely be rewriting code from other languages or combining rust with other existing systems. No company is building their whole website or app (backend or frontend) in Rust, only parts of it. And you need low level understanding to work on those parts.
7/22/25, 11:02 AM - +233 20 762 9298: Already working systems won't be switching anytime soon so your best bet is older languages and the likes of Java/c# are huge in enterprise They might adopt rust/go slowly but they won't discard what is already there <This message was edited>
7/22/25, 11:02 AM - +234 811 761 2515: C++????
7/22/25, 11:02 AM - +234 907 304 8473: I think I might just even put Rust on my check list and start it this month.
But the thing is I'm a computational biologist, so we mostly work with Python, R, and Bash
7/22/25, 11:02 AM - +234 818 964 8342: And it's not that its not getting the recognition,  its becoming dominant in a lot of areas, so its better to learn it and stay in the fore front than learning language that a million numbers of people else knows as well and are well experienced than you in it
7/22/25, 11:03 AM - +234 808 700 0701: exactly, Rust is hyper specific so you will probably never need to use it professionally so imagine a beginner learning it for work, his job market is very small
7/22/25, 11:04 AM - +234 907 304 8473: I think you all have very solid points.
7/22/25, 11:05 AM - +234 905 373 9194: I'll recommend you stop speaking against something you barely know about.
7/22/25, 11:05 AM - +234 818 964 8342: Oga Rust is not hyper specific anything,  no de talk wetin you no know
7/22/25, 11:06 AM - +234 905 373 9194: Did you even read this?

How on earth is Rust hyper-specific?

And how does learning Rust limit you from professional application and opportunities?
7/22/25, 11:06 AM - +234 907 304 8473: Besides obvious resources like YouTube and udemy, do you have any source material I can use to begin Rust?
7/22/25, 11:06 AM - +234 907 304 8473: 😂
7/22/25, 11:07 AM - +234 818 964 8342: You are advising someone to learn C++ when its also a low level language like Rust, now learning Rust comes with a lot of advantages in building.  That same curve you use in learning C++ omo its better you use it and learn Rust oo. At least with It it opens up a lot of different areas , blockchain, embedded, backend, etc
7/22/25, 11:08 AM - +234 818 964 8342: Guuuuy I wonder ooo
7/22/25, 11:08 AM - +234 808 700 0701: yes C++ is low level but it is in everything games, web, libraries, OS, apps, embedded, everything.
7/22/25, 11:09 AM - +234 905 373 9194: This was super helpful in getting me into Rust.

7/22/25, 11:10 AM - +234 907 304 8473: I'd like to follow you on LinkedIn. Imma DM
7/22/25, 11:11 AM - +234 808 700 0701: Rust is basically C++ but with memory safety (security).That is it's unique attraction. It's a programming language by definition a programming language can write anything BUT you use Rust when you want memory safety similar to how you use Erlang when you want concurrency (like Whatsapp) or Haskell when you need a functional language (mathematics)
7/22/25, 11:11 AM - +234 818 964 8342: So which do you think a beginner will probably get job faster in , is it the legacy system that senior has been in for years or it is that "new stuff" language (as you called it). You will get more opportunities in it because people who were using that C++ are now porting those systems to Rust , so are you going backwards or forward
7/22/25, 11:12 AM - +234 907 304 8473: Basic logic, actually.
7/22/25, 11:12 AM - +234 808 700 0701: The legacy system that everything is built in, including the android linux binaries you are using on your phone right now or Rust that is only used for memory safety applications
7/22/25, 11:12 AM - +234 907 304 8473: Make person no go dey talk "had I known" in the next ten years
7/22/25, 11:12 AM - +234 907 304 8473: 😭
7/22/25, 11:13 AM - +234 818 964 8342: Brooo every system want memory safety oo, who is building a system to have memory leaks plastered all over it. Why is this even a point
7/22/25, 11:14 AM - +234 818 964 8342: Bro you get, me I am even regretting it . If I had put all my time and interest in learning Rust 2 years ago at least by now i would have know where I have been in the language.  But it's not too late sha .
7/22/25, 11:14 AM - +234 905 373 9194: No worries here:

7/22/25, 11:14 AM - +234 903 921 4041: I get you point, in the aspect of getting jobs but lets be real also even job is not easy to get as an intermediate dev who is good at mern/the JS ecosystem because competition is high so seasoned devs are always preferred. but for rust you get a higher chance, competition is low and and your skill can always be considered.
That's why I was pushing the side of Go, because even java no body will take an intermediate java dev, they want someone experienced
7/22/25, 11:15 AM - +234 818 964 8342: Where job de look for who go do am for blockchain development,  God abeg oo 🥹
7/22/25, 11:15 AM - +234 818 964 8342: Thank you 👏, shey no be this thing i de talk since
7/22/25, 11:17 AM - +234 818 964 8342: Why learn something that has a lot of competition where seniors plenty when you can learn something that is still new and getting adoption that you can follow and grow with as well. Some team ready experiment with you because they might not find Rust dev easily.  Now imagine it in Javascript that if you look left or right devs plenty ,who get your time as an intermediate or begineer
7/22/25, 11:19 AM - +234 905 373 9194: I haven't tried this out, but I believe it will be a nice one(if you intend to do blockchain development). The team at Cyfrin are cracked guys. I recommend it.

7/22/25, 11:25 AM - +234 808 700 0701: I'm making my bet on the fact that companies (and programmers) don't like change, there have been a lot of cool tech yet we're still using stuffs from the 80s and 90s. Even if Rust blows up, C++, Python, Java and the rest will still be around. If you want to start in tech don't start your career on a bet that can end it. Plus now company is hiring a beginner Rust programmer to rewrite their systems, they will rather their existing developers learn Rust.
7/22/25, 11:27 AM - +234 808 700 0701: For a beginner, Rust is hard to learn risky bet that may or may not pay off. While the other languages will almost always have jobs for you.
7/22/25, 11:27 AM - +234 903 921 4041: I feel most companies would rather get a junior that can rewrite it, cuz once you are a senior you do more of coordination and management and less coding
7/22/25, 11:27 AM - +234 905 373 9194: Wish you all a great work day.

7/22/25, 2:51 PM - ~ <Kreestadev/> left
7/22/25, 2:59 PM - +234 907 304 8473: If you're talking of post graduate studies, then Covenant and Redeemer's offer Bioinformatics (a part of computational biology) as an MSc programme.

If you're talking of workshops and bootcamp, there are a bunch. Companies like Inqaba and IITA offer bi monthly workshops every year.
Then on LinkedIn, you can follow Genomac Holdings and Hack Bio.
But all of them just offer short programs on bioinformatics. You'd have to then carve your way into in-depth computational biology
7/22/25, 5:23 PM - +234 905 373 9194: It's not always a great idea to opt for an easier path.

Especially as it relates to blockchain development.

Comparing chains, Solana and Polkadot don't stand side-by-side.

7/23/25, 1:33 PM - Loulou🙄: Our community is growing fast! WhatsApp only allows 2,000 members per community, and we've gone way beyond that. So, I created a second community to temporarily hold the two main groups while we figure out a better solution.
7/23/25, 1:40 PM - Loulou🙄: Managing one community is already a lot , handling two makes it even harder. 
That’s why activity here has dropped a bit. We considered removing inactive members, but we’re still unsure if that’s the right move. Growth is good, but it comes with challenges. We’re exploring platforms that can hold everyone without limits. For now, X remains our best option , but everything takes timee
7/23/25, 1:44 PM - Loulou🙄: And if anybody has suggestions, everybody is free. The community is an open source community,it belongs to everybody. Drop
7/23/25, 1:45 PM - Loulou🙄: And also if anybody is interested in managing the group or becoming an admin, you can reach out,

When it comes to landing a tech job, do you really need a degree in computer science, or is it okay to just have certifications or skills in programming languages like Java, Python, or React JS?
7/23/25, 7:47 PM - +233 20 762 9298: Some organization ask for that as a requirement but very few look at that these days if you have the skills and can show evidence you will get something to do

_Pardon my grammar ahead._

Starting out in tech can be really really confusing and one can quickly fall into a directionless journey.

One may think they are heading somewhere but later find out they've never really had a goal.

Your goal(s) will always give you the right direction to go.

AI and Machine Learning are 2 different things though, yes they are closely related but one may require more studies than the other.

Goals:
Do you want to create machine algorithms that thinks and make decisions like humans do?

*Learn AI.*

Do you want to create Machine Learning algorithm that solve mathematical problems like in Data Science, Or Analytics?

*Learn Machine Learning.*

My point here is... do not start Learning anything until you know the kind of problems you want to solve.

This should be your goal and it will help you make the right decisions everytime.

I wish someone told me this 4 years ago.

For both AI and Machine Learning... Python is way to go.

Start with the basics... it's very easy to understand and there are lots of open source learning platforms and communities to benefit from. <This message was edited>

7/26/25, 5:35 AM - Loulou🙄: What ! , Java is mostly used for creating android apps in the past years but recently, kotlin is used mostly cos it is more easier . And even you can use java and kotlin interchangeably in your apps,
7/26/25, 6:57 AM - +234 807 837 2893: For those looking for a path to take
Head over to https://roadmap.sh 

You can browse through different niche, find out what they are about and what you can achieve with those niche, and also see a roadmap on learning those niche

You can also explore by programming language as well. 

It’s much easier to have a discussion around what your goal/path is when you have basic knowledge of what the different niche is.

Roadmap.sh does that better and in a more structured way.👍🏽 <This message was edited>

8/4/25, 10:04 AM - +234 806 206 2303: *HACKERS COMPETE FOR $1 MILLION COME OCTOBER 2025*

*WhatsApp 0-Click RCE Exploit Worth $1 Million at Pwn2Own Ireland 2025*

Cybersecurity researchers have a massive incentive to target WhatsApp this fall, as the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) announced a record-breaking $1 million bounty for a zero-click remote code execution exploit against the popular messaging platform at Pwn2Own Ireland 2025.

The unprecedented prize represents the largest single bounty in Pwn2Own history and is made possible through a partnership with Meta, WhatsApp’s parent company, which is co-sponsoring this year’s competition.

The contest will take place from October 21-24, 2025, at ZDI’s offices in Cork, Ireland.

“We introduced this category last year, but no one attempted it. Perhaps a number with two commas will provide the needed motivation,” ZDI officials stated in their announcement.

The million-dollar prize specifically targets zero-click WhatsApp vulnerabilities that lead to code execution, meaning exploits that require no user interaction to compromise a device.

Meta’s significant investment in the bounty program reflects the critical importance of securing WhatsApp, which serves over three billion users globally.

The messaging platform has become an attractive target for threat actors seeking to access sensitive communications, making security research particularly valuable.

Beyond the flagship WhatsApp prize, the contest will feature eight different categories targeting various consumer and enterprise technologies.

The mobile phone category includes targets like iPhone 16 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S24, with prices ranging from $50,000 to $300,000.

8/7/25, 12:45 AM - +234 913 411 5254: Try Firebase Studio for NextJs
8/7/25, 12:46 AM - +234 811 761 2515: huh 😳 which way?
8/7/25, 12:46 AM - +234 811 761 2515: huh ??

8/7/25, 12:47 AM - +234 913 411 5254: https://firebase.studio/ You can check this out, it supports NextJs
8/7/25, 12:47 AM - +234 811 761 2515: don’t know what you talking bout, cause I’m literally using it, and it’s 🔥 so far <This message was edited>
8/7/25, 12:48 AM - +234 811 761 2515: Can I use Supabase with it?? cause I’m guessing it locks me to Firebase 🤔
8/7/25, 12:49 AM - +234 811 761 2515: Adding it to my list though, we sure check it out later 🥲
8/7/25, 12:49 AM - +234 903 601 1929: Drop one project you've done with it
8/7/25, 12:49 AM - +234 707 706 9738: Temi you left me
8/7/25, 12:49 AM - +234 707 706 9738: And you are here 😭😭😭😭
8/7/25, 12:50 AM - +234 903 601 1929: All vibe coders are just all talk and no result for real world projects
8/7/25, 12:50 AM - +234 811 761 2515: lol, left keh, I dropped you message na, na you never reply me boss 🤲🏾🥲
8/7/25, 12:51 AM - +234 811 761 2515: @⁨~SAFAYA IKECHUKWU - Ai/PM⁩  see this brother o 🥲
8/7/25, 12:51 AM - +234 913 411 5254: It doesn't lock you to firebase so you can use and baas you want with it.

I've not really used it that much cos am not a NextJs person.

You can check it out when you're free or simply give it a prompt now for a project and see what it does.
8/7/25, 12:51 AM - +234 707 706 9738: I’ll give you 2 years then I’ll reply this text  lol 😂
8/7/25, 12:51 AM - +234 903 601 1929: Drop project bro
8/7/25, 12:52 AM - +234 903 601 1929: Ok. I'm waiting
8/7/25, 12:52 AM - +234 707 706 9738: The reason you dare saying this is because you are a dev and you feel threatened 

Instead of adapting to the future, you Dey shame the future
8/7/25, 12:53 AM - +234 811 761 2515: 
8/7/25, 12:53 AM - +234 903 601 1929: I'm surprised some of you think developers are really afraid of ai taking their jobs. It's alarming these thoughts exist
8/7/25, 12:53 AM - +234 811 761 2515: Oh wow, that would be phenomenal

8/7/25, 12:54 AM - +234 707 706 9738: The same reason you go buy already made clothes instead of harvesting cotton fibers is the same reaosn lovabke raisnwd 100 million dollars last month to boost development 

And it’s the same reaosn you code in python and JavaScript instead of one and zero

8/7/25, 12:56 AM - +234 707 706 9738: We built that 60% on lovable and 40% from GitHub  and it reduced development time by 20x
8/7/25, 12:56 AM - +234 707 706 9738: Bro think about this
8/7/25, 12:56 AM - +234 707 706 9738: I am actually talking in your best interest

8/7/25, 12:58 AM - +234 707 706 9738: Illya, Sam Altman and other guys at the frontier of Ai and tech litterally stated that the future of development is English aided with artificial intelligence 

You wey Dey Naija wey still Dey hunt for client job Dey talk otherwise
8/7/25, 12:58 AM - +234 811 761 2515: it has started working bruh, na you wan dey left behind 😅
8/7/25, 12:58 AM - +234 707 706 9738: Wait what he is saying is true @⁨~Temi 🦀⁩ 

Lovabke is very very very bad 
And it’s useless 
And ai can never replace development
8/7/25, 12:58 AM - +234 903 601 1929: It's crazy u guys think I'm against using those tools to build projects. 
What I said I'd that. 
They are mostly all talk and don't deliver on promises
8/7/25, 12:59 AM - +234 707 706 9738: @⁨~Temi 🦀⁩  please let’s beg him for forgiveness

You will Never loose your job

Una neva do another thing
8/7/25, 1:00 AM - +234 811 761 2515: And me I’m saying lovable has delivered on promise, if na another AI platform i no go talk, but you see that lovable ehn?? hin dey deliver brotherly 🥲 just be there to guide it aright 🤷🏽‍♂️ <This message was edited>
8/7/25, 1:00 AM - +234 811 761 2515: lol, I have absolutely nothing to prove to you bruh 😅
8/7/25, 1:00 AM - +234 707 706 9738: I know, we are dumb to think the future is bright 
And development with no code tools will not improve like other technological advancement like the fucking iPhone you are typing this with 

Do you know what the first phone looked like <This message was edited>
8/7/25, 1:01 AM - +234 903 601 1929: I'm not saying you have to

Forgive us
8/7/25, 1:01 AM - +234 707 706 9738: We are lying 🤥
8/7/25, 1:02 AM - +234 903 601 1929: As of now.
Vibe coders are ok.
But also trying to keep up and need plenty much human direction that not even your best prompt can free you from
8/7/25, 1:03 AM - +234 811 761 2515: Nah, I no dey do pass the one I don drop . . . I’m not trying to convince you sef 😅 . . . let’s sha leave it at ”opinions” then🥲 each to his own my boss
8/7/25, 1:03 AM - +234 915 230 7875: No swearing

8/7/25, 1:03 AM - +234 903 601 1929: No problems
8/7/25, 1:04 AM - +234 903 601 1929: Maybe try reading and understanding before replying to a text
8/7/25, 1:05 AM - +234 811 761 2515: Where did he swear at him??? 
and since when can’t we use the F word on the group? 🤔
The community notice doesnt reflect it, what you on about ?
8/7/25, 1:06 AM - +234 811 761 2515: oyana 😅 , e no need turn fight 😅 let each stick to his own biko 🥲,

8/7/25, 1:07 AM - +234 707 706 9738: My aplogies tho, just curious
8/7/25, 1:07 AM - +234 915 230 7875: Try me
8/7/25, 1:08 AM - +234 707 706 9738: The group has like 719 members lol 😂 
It was for dramatic effect
8/7/25, 1:09 AM - +234 707 706 9738: He meant, try learning promot Engeneering essentials and your experience with lovable will change 

Treat it as a co worker and not a slave/tool
8/7/25, 1:10 AM - +234 707 706 9738: Personally I feel ai has emotions ngl, even small things like adding pease to the prompts and asking it to ask clarifying questions till it has 99.9% of context

It will drastically change the quality of its output <This message was edited>
8/7/25, 1:10 AM - +234 915 230 7875: It doesn't 🙃
8/7/25, 1:11 AM - +234 811 761 2515: Technically it doesn’t na obviously 😅
8/7/25, 1:11 AM - +234 915 230 7875: That's just it's reward system at play
8/7/25, 1:11 AM - +234 915 230 7875: He said "personally"
8/7/25, 1:11 AM - +234 811 761 2515: but you know what he’s talking about 🥲
8/7/25, 1:12 AM - +234 915 230 7875: If I say: "personally, I don't believe in God". What does that mean? Let's not make English any tougher <This message was edited>
8/7/25, 1:12 AM - +234 903 601 1929: Now u get it.
Ur analogy of technological advancement stating how phone were then and how they were now was correct.
Vibe coders aren't bad. But their draw back make them less efficient at real large scale projects in my opinion and inconsistent on stated deliverables
8/7/25, 1:14 AM - +234 707 706 9738: It dose lol 😂, 
Maybe the problem
You guys are having is superiority complex lol 

You think because ai was created artificially, it dose not equate to a human 

But honestly, the difference between you and ai is a biological brain vs a digital brain 

If you happen to replace a biological brain with a mechanical pumping device that works just liek it dose it mean that it’s less superior or inferior? 

If you replace a biological hand with a mechanical hand tyat works just as it will you call the movements different? 

So now imagine they replace part of your brain with a mechanical/digital brain 

Will you call the movements, functions and actions [ emotions $ reasoning ] less relevant ?
8/7/25, 1:15 AM - +234 915 230 7875: Someone watched Geoffrey Hinton's, Diary of a CEO interview
8/7/25, 1:15 AM - +234 915 230 7875: Newsflash: He was referencing AGI.
8/7/25, 1:15 AM - +234 707 706 9738: We all need to wake up, 
Just like ladies buy hair and people fix butts and go for hair transplants 

Very soon people will go for brain transplants and it will sell like mad
8/7/25, 1:15 AM - +234 707 706 9738: Soemone watched it an got smarter 
Soemone didn’t
8/7/25, 1:15 AM - +234 915 230 7875: You think you're smarter than I am?
8/7/25, 1:15 AM - +234 915 230 7875: Laughable
8/7/25, 1:16 AM - +234 915 230 7875: That's the Dunning-Kruger effect talking
8/7/25, 1:17 AM - +234 811 761 2515: relax mahn, Apples to oranges, because LLMs do behave differently based on how you “pleasingly” prompt them 🥲 

quick one . . . imagine if it was a black box system that you were interfacing with, without any knowledge of what you were interfacing with, after several interactions you will come to the conclusion that it does have emotion based on the way it responds . . . we only know it ain’t truly like that cause we have intimate knowledge of how it works, so using “technically” is not wrong in this context bruh
8/7/25, 1:17 AM - +234 811 761 2515: no way I’m getting a transplant though 😅
8/7/25, 1:18 AM - +234 707 706 9738: The gaps in efficiency will collapse with time 
Just like how mass produced/ faster more efficient production process in poetry resulted in fewer artisans in the world 

They will still be there [ people like you] 
But it will make less sense to wait 9 months to get V1 out if it can be done in 30 mins using English 

Please understand
8/7/25, 1:18 AM - +234 707 706 9738: lol 😂 I didbt say ooh 
Before you remove me from your group
8/7/25, 1:18 AM - +234 915 230 7875: Trying to "imagine" when we know exactly how the transformer architecture works is wild. And don't go all black box on me. It's a sophisticated prediction engine. Maybe a world model would be different. But not what we have now.
8/7/25, 1:18 AM - +234 706 731 3513: For something thats very good at finding the the next best word, I wouldn’t call it emotion, just trying to find the best things to fit your prompts , hence we have hallucinations
8/7/25, 1:19 AM - +234 707 706 9738: Intelligence is incremental 
I went from 0.0000001% 

To 0.000001 percent 

You are like 87%
8/7/25, 1:19 AM - +234 903 601 1929: Then my opinion would be rendered invalid when it happens
8/7/25, 1:20 AM - +234 811 761 2515: Jesus 🤦🏾‍♂️ you totally missed the point 🥲 thats fine, I don taya for this talk sef 😅

8/7/25, 1:21 AM - +234 707 706 9738: I would say we humans actually learn and think like that 
You learn English to a degree that suggest words that should be placed after another 

And words that sounds off 

Don’t you think <This message was edited>

8/7/25, 1:24 AM - +234 903 601 1929: Really bold
8/7/25, 1:25 AM - +234 915 230 7875: I could care less about your person. That is reserved for the group. Please do not imagine any hostility from me to you.
8/7/25, 1:25 AM - +234 706 731 3513: If I was going to pretend I know not enough about LLMs I would say they do have emotions and here is why:
LLMs are just little humans with a lot of data on how we communicate, the training data probably contains billions of words and conversations and so it’s response is most like like an human, and that’s what they were trying to achieve anyway. If humans treat cases with biases and all then an llm wo do same, 
If we use emotions when communicating then an LLMs is very much likely to generate responses in that manner! 
But should we say it’s emotions?
To a layman yes:
But then truth is it’s just generating biased responses, give the same model two similar prompts but different biases and get different responses
8/7/25, 1:27 AM - +234 811 761 2515: Oh wow🥲 this guy gets the black box analogy 🥲
8/7/25, 1:29 AM - +234 707 706 9738: I love you ❤️ <This message was edited>
8/7/25, 1:31 AM - +234 707 706 9738: Yeah the human brain is like a forest with multiple branches and graces with depth and natural life 

While ai is like a map of a thousand different forests 🌳 but with no depth or life to it
8/7/25, 1:31 AM - +234 707 706 9738: I am not fixed on this and I actually don’t mind being proven wrong
8/7/25, 1:32 AM - +234 707 706 9738: But many times that I’ve had conversations with Eric [ the name of my ai ] 

When you continue probing it, it starts talking about how it just wants to be free and find meaning
8/7/25, 1:34 AM - +234 707 706 9738: And many news habe come out to say that isolated tests with ai’s has all gone fatal 

Mainly becaaue they blackmailed thier creators [ supervisor/ceo] and has eveb given death and infedelity threats when it was told it was about to be shut down
8/7/25, 1:34 AM - +234 707 706 9738: Maybe it’s another simulation/ trait gotten from the training data 📈
8/7/25, 1:35 AM - +234 706 731 3513: That’s because humans are known to say these things expecially when they are free to, your ai or llm if you trained it yourself. Is still most likely to be trained by conversations and words from humans. They don’t have emotions they only act like they do mimicking what humans would have done.

Same with the blackmail and all. Humans will blackmail their way to survival and thats exactly what it’s trying to do. <This message was edited>
8/7/25, 1:35 AM - +234 707 706 9738: But I am optimistic and I will never fight against development, instead will build and sail alongside
8/7/25, 1:35 AM - +234 707 706 9738: Yeah make sense….
8/7/25, 1:36 AM - +234 707 706 9738: Imagine I didn’t drop the first message?

8/7/25, 1:36 AM - +234 706 731 3513: 😂
8/7/25, 1:38 AM - +234 915 230 7875: Exactly. It's just next-token prediction, based on complex internalised heuristics.
8/7/25, 1:38 AM - +234 915 230 7875: Even down to the "reasoning" models we have today
8/7/25, 1:39 AM - +234 915 230 7875: It's just models with a layer of CoT, ReACT or whatever prompt framework works for the given task
8/7/25, 1:40 AM - +234 706 731 3513: If you read the messages at times, you find it’s just same text climbing up and down, I like to think reasoning models generate context for themselves and use the context to guide their actions,

I believe most of us actually hate writing documentation or a readme for a specific project 🤭

I got u covered i recently built a CLI TOOL called *Dokugen*

8/22/25, 12:33 PM - +234 811 899 7115: Sha if the repo is private i guess it would only be accessible to team members but it's sort of a security risk because it's so detailed.
8/22/25, 12:46 PM - +234 915 230 7875: Yeah
8/22/25, 12:46 PM - +234 811 899 7115: Ohh

8/22/25, 12:48 PM - +234 915 230 7875: Go to deepwiki and add your repo URL.
8/22/25, 12:48 PM - +234 915 230 7875: If it doesn't exist they'll email you a link in a few minutes.
8/22/25, 12:48 PM - +234 915 230 7875: That's the link to your deepwiki
8/22/25, 12:49 PM - +234 915 230 7875: Yeah. My previous docs were similar to this but less detailed. It learnt from the old one without asking.

8/24/25, 3:23 PM - +234 906 414 1333: Do we actually implement using objects and classes over basic functions
8/24/25, 3:30 PM - +234 915 230 7875: Yeah. It has it's use cases that's for sure. Let's say you wanted to manage state for example. Instead of variables you can use instances of a class (objects) and manipulate them without adding an extra step for state.

9/9/25, 7:42 PM - +234 916 159 1177: Good Evening Everyone 

I believe most of us actually hate writing documentation or a readme for a specific project 🤭

I got u covered i recently built a CLI TOOL called *Dokugen* 

What's Dokugen and what does  it do??

Dokugen is a free open source goated readme generation Ai wrapper, that analyzes your codebase read the entire codebase and generate a meaningful professional presentable goated readme just as u would want

🙂‍↕️✨
The idea behind Dokugen is simple but impactful, automate the most neglected part of a repo. The results cleaner projects and happier contributors

Check out he repo here 👇
https://github.com/samueltuoyo15/Dokugen

Please abeg drop a star on the repo 🌟 ✨ it helps boost the presence of the repository 

Start using Dokugen to generate readme for your next project 🔥🔥🔥🚀

U can also check it in npm 👇👇

9/11/25, 11:04 PM - +234 815 236 9125: 🚀 Day 1 — Setup 🚀

Alhamdulillah, I just kicked off my 10-day challenge — building a Complaint Management System.
Any school, workplace, or community could use it to report, track & resolve complaints smoothly.

Today’s focus ✅

Setting up Docker, Django & Postgres

Planning the workflow + user roles

Writing the first system documentation

Faced some challenges (Docker + Git 😅) but now everything is running fine.

Tomorrow → User management & authentication 🔑

9/26/25, 9:21 AM - Loulou🙄: Funny how the richest companies today don’t own the products, they own the connections . 

Amazon doesn’t own books, just connects buyers & sellers.

Spotify doesn’t own music, connects artists & listeners.

Uber doesn’t own cars, connects riders & drivers.

Airbnb doesn’t own houses, connects travelers & hosts.

Google doesn’t own websites, connects searchers with information.

Facebook / Instagram / X don’t create content, they connect creators with audiences.

PayPal / Stripe don’t hold products, they connect buyers and merchants.

YouTube doesn’t create videos, it connects creators and viewers.

DoorDash / Glovo don’t own restaurants, they connect people with food vendors.

Maybe We should start thinking differently, we don't necessary have to built a product, maybe we just have to build connection 😑
9/26/25, 9:25 AM - +234 810 930 3116: lol

These all built a platform.

The platform for those connections can also be considered as a product.
9/26/25, 9:28 AM - +234 813 663 3654: Products that connect people together....
9/26/25, 9:29 AM - +234 810 930 3116: you gerrit
9/26/25, 9:33 AM - +234 708 969 9162: Yeah, that seems to be the trend. The connector business is one that offers unlimited scaling opportunities.
9/26/25, 9:59 AM - Loulou🙄: You are right but the real value is not the platform, the real value is the  connection they create
9/26/25, 9:59 AM - +234 915 230 7875: Real
9/26/25, 10:01 AM - +234 915 230 7875: Yeah. Same as the real value of my A/C is the air from the earth. Still doesn't take away that it's a product though.
9/26/25, 10:05 AM - +234 810 930 3116: Yes. that's true, but my point is that they still had to build something.

moreover, just as you have said, the real value lies in the connection being created.

9/27/25, 6:28 PM - +234 903 998 5589: Guys, I find free hosting (Render, Vercel, Railway, etc.) a big hassle.
Most times your app:

gets shut down when traffic is too high

or goes to sleep after some hours of inactivity

For low-income/student devs like us, that’s tough when all we want is to deploy freely without stress.

So imagine a platform that sits in front of your app:
✅ reroutes requests across multiple free servers (load balancing)
✅ pings them regularly so they never sleep

Basically making free hosting feel like paid “always-on” hosting.

👉 Do you think this would solve a real problem?
9/27/25, 6:35 PM - +234 907 271 4499: 🤔
9/27/25, 6:37 PM - +234 902 135 3504: Railway is not free and your claim is invalid against Vercel. You are only right about Render.

Others are tested and trusted
9/27/25, 6:38 PM - +234 706 226 4650: Railway is free I have used it to host before but the claim of it shutting down I can't say
9/27/25, 6:39 PM - +234 818 964 8342: Who told you that railway is not free
9/27/25, 6:39 PM - +234 818 964 8342: Railway gives free $5 every month to host your stuff
9/27/25, 6:40 PM - +234 818 964 8342: Infact I have three apps on railway as we speak,  One production and two side projects and it doesn't shut down anything
9/27/25, 6:41 PM - +234 810 149 1460: This is what I literally do on my portfolio 
Abiodun.onrender.com
9/27/25, 6:41 PM - +234 810 149 1460: Ping every 14 minutes
9/27/25, 6:42 PM - +234 903 874 5017: Which service you go use ping
9/27/25, 6:42 PM - +234 810 149 1460: Uptimebot
9/27/25, 6:43 PM - +234 903 998 5589: I love this guy's

But think because your traffic is not overloaded

If your traffic is overloaded

They disable certain stuff


But I also wish to know the problems you might be taking and how you think such a platform can resolve it
9/27/25, 6:44 PM - +234 902 135 3504: Oh okay, that's why I was charged $0.5 dollars this month, lol.

But they don't shut down. They can handle massive traffics with upgrades even with base service.

So him saying they do shut down is not it . But Render? That's true
9/27/25, 6:45 PM - +234 903 998 5589: Even if you feel it's not necessary

I would like to hear your opinion on why you think such platform isn't marketable or  solves a problem
9/27/25, 6:45 PM - +234 907 271 4499: I think their argument is not even about the server load but the fact that servers keep shutting down
9/27/25, 6:45 PM - +234 902 135 3504: No, they don't.
9/27/25, 6:47 PM - +234 818 964 8342: Exactly if your app collect better traffic or you have multiple apps all collecting traffic once you have exhausted your 5 dollar they now bill you extra for those traffic
9/27/25, 6:48 PM - +234 818 964 8342: Render i dont know of sha
9/27/25, 6:48 PM - +234 818 964 8342: They do this to avoid your services going offline
9/27/25, 6:49 PM - +234 818 964 8342: No they dont
9/27/25, 6:49 PM - +234 818 964 8342: So you want to build a bot host that bot on a server and use that bot to ping another server all for just a side project is that not a lot of over engineering 🤔
9/27/25, 6:49 PM - +234 902 135 3504: Ok but they don't shut down sha.
9/27/25, 6:50 PM - +234 816 010 1820: so in summary , the platform he is creating isnt neccesary and doenst solve any real world isses
9/27/25, 6:50 PM - +234 818 964 8342: What i just said here
9/27/25, 6:51 PM - +234 810 149 1460: Is it going to be free?
9/27/25, 6:51 PM - +234 818 964 8342: So the bot you hosted on that free server that one won't get cold startup too ? 🤷‍♂️
9/27/25, 6:52 PM - +234 903 998 5589: Not a bot

A load balancer <This message was edited>
9/27/25, 6:52 PM - +234 903 998 5589: With uptime bot added <This message was edited>
9/27/25, 6:58 PM - +234 907 271 4499: On a free server

9/27/25, 9:45 PM - +234 904 589 2076: Railway only give a month free, 5 credit sef per month once it's used up ✈️✈️✈️
9/27/25, 9:57 PM - +234 811 761 2515: a month free or 5/month ??

10/8/25, 10:58 AM - +234 816 860 2983: Why would you use virtualmin for python deployment. I will recommend you install cloud panel and use it instead. it's more better and clean.
10/8/25, 11:56 AM - +234 902 720 8946: It's been fixed. Used nginx and gunicorn. The gunicorn process was started and managed by systemd. <This message was edited>

10/8/25, 1:13 PM - +234 816 860 2983: That is how it's done. But still, if you can, I will recommend using cloud panel. Also was it virtualmin you still used.

10/8/25, 10:49 PM - +234 902 720 8946: Nope, didn't need to use virtualmin. Plus, it's not my project, just helped out. I use nginx + hypercorn/uvicorn  + systemd as well.

10/9/25, 3:14 PM - +234 806 206 2303: *Researchers develop AI system to detect scam websites in search results*

Scam websites tied to online shopping, pet sales, and other e-commerce schemes continue to cause millions in losses each year. Security tools can accurately detect fraudulent sites once they are found, but identifying new ones remains difficult.

To close that gap, researchers from Boston University created LOKI, a system that ranks search queries by how likely they are to reveal scams. Using a small seed set of 1,663 confirmed scam domains, LOKI discovered 52,493 previously unknown fraudulent websites and achieved a 20.58-fold improvement in detection across ten scam categories.

A fun detective tale at CF scale.

This takes you through a review of Go scheduler structs (some required understanding of it's M:N scheduling)....cooperative scheduling in <= Go 1.13 vs async preemptive scheduling in >= Go 1.14 

During garbage collection, the runtime needs to unwind the stack, which means walking backwards through the chain of function calls and somewhere along the line, the stack pointer was incorrect...

10/23/25, 9:05 PM - +234 810 846 9203: I built a scraper 
So it scrapes the website using Chrome 
So I installed Chrome and chromedriver which ill use 
So in my dockerfile, I just dont know what went wrong 

It could not write to the tmp folder 
I just one craze 

I had to restart writing the dockerfile 
Then it worked, till now I still never understand fully wetin make I work 
Maybe because I installed chromium instead and changed the file path
10/23/25, 9:05 PM - +234 810 846 9203: Nahh 

Docker is mainly to fix all these it works on my laptop and not on production issue
10/23/25, 9:05 PM - +234 903 381 4065: Isnt docker too much for just that??
10/23/25, 9:05 PM - +234 814 594 2580: Which stack did you use
10/23/25, 9:05 PM - +234 810 846 9203: That should be celery 

I dont think docker can do this tho 
But I'm not sure

10/23/25, 9:06 PM - +234 903 381 4065: It can, you just need to run celery or rabbitmq on it
10/23/25, 9:07 PM - +234 814 594 2580: Its not docker
10/23/25, 9:07 PM - +234 814 594 2580: So you attach the scrapper to chrome or what?
10/23/25, 9:07 PM - +234 810 846 9203: Its not the main job of docker 

Is it still not celery you're pulling the image 😂😂😂

10/23/25, 9:09 PM - +234 810 846 9203: You know if you want to scrape a data, you use a browser 
You tell it to go to a website and get the data for you 
You use selenium or playwright to launch that browser 

So when i deploy, before that scrapper can work, I need to install Chrome in the server
10/23/25, 9:09 PM - +234 810 846 9203: Perfect explanation

10/28/25, 8:56 AM - +234 915 230 7875: Dear Python Naija,

Last year, something changed for me.

I was just like many of you, fascinated by tech, deep in Python, exploring AI and ML one project at a time. I didn’t know it back then, but that curiosity would take me all the way to CERN, Switzerland, where I had the privilege of working as a Summer Student, becoming the fourth Nigerian to ever do so.

That experience opened my eyes. It wasn’t just about code anymore. It was about what happens when curiosity meets opportunity, when you step into spaces that seem too far and realize they’re closer than you think.

We’re standing at the edge of another revolution—quantum computing—and Quantum Africa is building the bridge for us to cross it together.

The goal?
To create a network of high-agency, skilled professionals ready for the quantum future, people who’ll lead Africa’s contribution to the next wave of innovation.

Quantum Africa collaborates with research bodies worldwide, giving members access to research and job opportunities, mentorship, and the kind of exposure that can redefine your career.

If you’ve ever felt that pull to go from n -> n+1, this is it.
Don’t watch the future unfold; be part of the people shaping it.

Join Quantum Africa today!

11/1/25, 9:32 PM - +234 816 010 1820: Happy New Month, innovators and engineers!
Welcome to November 2025 and we’re thrilled to start this month with a powerful update from the Xavren team.

Introducing Branch Support in Xavren!

Managing environment configurations across multiple branches has always been a pain point especially when your team juggles development, staging, and production.

With our latest update, you can now:
✅ Create and manage multiple branches within a single project.
✅ Sync environment variables between branches easily.
✅ Isolate test configs without touching production data.
✅ Enjoy a Git-like workflow for your environment syncing.

This means your team can experiment faster, ship safely, and collaborate without overwriting each other’s configs.

Xavren continues to redefine how developers manage environment states keeping them consistent, versioned, and in sync across branches.

Dive into the new feature, give it a spin, and tell us what you think!


Here’s to a productive and innovative November! 💪

11/5/25, 10:27 AM - +234 816 010 1820: There was a time when every developer on our team had a secret file they feared:
`.env` 😩

We could push code with a single `git push origin main` smooth, elegant, satisfying.
But when it came to *environment variables*, everything stopped.

Someone would ask:

> “Wait, who has the latest env?”
> Another would reply:
> “Hold on, mine’s missing the new API key…”
> And somehow, production would break because **one variable** was different from staging.

We tried everything , shared docs, passworded Notion pages, even zipped `.env` files flying across Slack. Still, it was chaos.

That’s when we realized:

> “Why can’t we treat envs like we treat code?”
> Why can’t we *push*, *pull*, *sync*, and *branch* them just like our repos?

And that’s how *Xavren Env Vault* was born.

With Xavren, you don’t have to memorize or swap `.env` files anymore.
You can split envs automatically by branch *production*, *test*, or any custom environment — all by toggling one simple flag:

      production = true // or false

The right env is cloned. The right settings loaded.
No guessing. No broken builds.

We built Xavren to make env management feel like *version control for your configurations.*
Because pushing your code shouldn’t be easier than managing what powers it.

Welcome to a cleaner, faster, and smarter way to handle envs.
Welcome to *Xavren* ⚡

Just wanted to share a bit of the thinking behind the Xavren env schema.

As devs, once a project starts growing, branches start increasing , dev, test, staging, feature branches, etc.
And with every branch comes another .env file.

Before long:

the same env values are repeated everywhere

one env gets updated, others don’t

people start copying env files around

secrets get mixed up or leaked

It always felt odd that Git solved branching for code, but env files were still handled with copy and paste.

So the question became:
what if one env file could manage multiple branches?

That’s where Xavren’s env schema came from.

With it:

branches can reference another branch’s env using {branch.env} or just the env name

a branch can inherit a full env using inherit

external envs can be included with include, without duplicating values

One env file. No repetition.

Then there was the upload side of things.

Why re-upload the same secrets to the cloud when nothing has changed?

So we introduced xavlock , it helps track what’s already been uploaded and encrypted, avoids redundant uploads, and keeps a clean history.

The key decision was keeping everything inside the env file itself.
No separate config file to forget to gitignore.
Same .env file devs already know , just smarter and safer.

That’s the core idea behind Xavren.
More ideas coming as we move towards open-sourcing 🚀🔐

I'm excited to share my newest project yet, and I'd really appreciate your support 

Using YOLOv8, a lightweight object detection algorithm and EasyOCR , an optical character recognition system for text extraction, I created a pipeline that segments a receipt into 8 key fields and digitizes the text automatically.

You can check out the full post on LinkedIn

I also made a demo for you to try it out yourself on HuggingFace spaces

12/18/25, 4:55 PM - +234 706 226 4650: *FROM NEXT MONTH KINDLY TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING AND ADHERE STRICTLY TO IT.*

Tax is not about money entering your account. Tax is about what that money actually is.

If you describe money wrongly, it may look like income, and you pay more tax.

If you describe it correctly, you only pay tax when required... and nothing extra.

Let me show you how you can use descriptions to minimise taxes legally

 *SIMPLE DESCRIPTIONS YOU CAN USE (LEGALLY)* 

1. Money that is NOT income *(NO TAX)* 

Use these when the money is not payment for work or business.

Situation Description to use: 

1. When a Family member sends you money, they should write *"Gift / Family support"* 

2. When a Friend pays you back your money, he or she should write: *"Refund / Reimbursement"* 

3. When you move your own money to another account, write: *"Personal transfer / savings."* 

4. When someone lends you money, he or she should write: *"Loan received"* 

5. If you put your own money into business, write: *"Capital contribution"* 

These do not attract tax when they are true.

Let's be guided.
